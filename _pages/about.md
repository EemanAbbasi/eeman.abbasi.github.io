# About me

Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Microbial Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania, with a background in Computer Science and Biological Sciences. Passionate about ecological medicine, I use mathematical models and bioinformatics to explore how host immune responses, diet, and the microbiome impact health and disease. My goal is to advance understanding of host-microbiome interactions and drive innovations in biomedical research.
