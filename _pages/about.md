# About Me

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Microbial Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania, with a background in Computer Science and Biological Sciences. Passionate about ecological medicine, I use mathematical models and bioinformatics to explore how host immune responses, diet, and the microbiome impact health and disease. My goal is to advance understanding of host-microbiome interactions and drive innovations in biomedical research. My academic journey began with a B.A. magna cum laude in Computer Science and Biology from Mount Holyoke College.
