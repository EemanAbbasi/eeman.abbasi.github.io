  Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/graduate-students">University of Pennsylvania</a>, with a background in Computer Science and Biological Sciences. Passionate about ecological medicine, I use mathematical models and bioinformatics to explore how host control the assmebly of the microbiome. My goal is to advance understanding of host-microbiome interactions and drive innovations in biomedical research.

### Data Science Intern, [Concerto Biosciences](https://www.concertobio.com) <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95984bcf-987a-44a0-88aa-693f2a240aed" alt="Concerto Biosciences Logo" width="350" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" id="concerto-thumbnail" />

- Analyzed fluorescence-tagged image datasets using Python-based analysis to identify combinations of microbes whose interactions supress the disease indication. 
- Nominated key microbial combinations for disease indications, aiding product development and presenting insights to leadership.
- Worked with the Senior Data Scientist to enhance data filtering processes and develop new machine learning methods for data optimization.
