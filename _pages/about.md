  I’m a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="https://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/graduate-students">University of Pennsylvania</a>, with a background in Computer Science and Biological Sciences. Passionate about ecological medicine, I use mathematical models and bioinformatics to explore how host control the assmebly of the microbiome. My goal is to advance understanding of host-microbiome interactions and drive innovations in biomedical research.
