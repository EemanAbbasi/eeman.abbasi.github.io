I’m a PhD candidate in Microbial Ecology at the University of Pennsylvania, with a background in Computer Science and Biological Sciences. Passionate about ecological medicine, I use mathematical models and bioinformatics to explore how host immune responses, diet, and the microbiome impact health and disease. My goal is to advance understanding of host-microbiome interactions and drive innovations in biomedical research. My academic journey began with a B.A. magna cum laude in Computer Science and Biology from Mount Holyoke College.

# Education

PhD Candidate at University of Pennsylvania 

Mount Holyoke College - B.A.,magna cum laude, Computer Science and Biology

# Relevant Experience     

### Data Science Intern, Concerto Biosciences <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95984bcf-987a-44a0-88aa-693f2a240aed" alt="Concerto Biosciences Logo" width="150" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
*April 2024 - Present*  

- Analyzed fluorescence-tagged image-based datasets to uncover biological signatures and assess microbial synergy through Python-based data analysis.
- Collaborated with the Senior Data Scientist to enhance data filtering methods and develop new approaches for optimizing the data discovery process.

### Role of Host Control on microbiome community assmebly 
My research at UPenn focuses on microbial ecology and community dynamics. I’ve developed a Python-based community ecology model to study how host immune responses shape microbial communities. I also conduct multi-omics data analysis on cancer microbiome datasets to validate model insights and am developing an agent-based model to explore the effects of social interactions on the microbiome. My work has been presented at the Young AMICI Symposium, and several manuscripts are currently under review.

### NIMBioS (National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis)
**Undergraduate Researcher**  
*May 2018 - December 2020*  
During my time at NIMBioS, I developed a computational model in R to simulate plant-seed disperser dynamics. I conducted sensitivity analysis using real-world parameter ranges to identify critical parameters for conservation efforts and co-authored a publication presented at the Doctoral Consortium on Computational Sustainability.

## Leadership and Community Engagement

I actively contribute to the academic community as a Probono Consultant for Penn Biotech Group and a Mini Capstone MBA Project at Wharton. I also lead career and wellness initiatives as the Career and Wellness Coordinator for the Biology Graduate Group and serve as a Graduate Resident Advisor at Hill College House. My past experience includes teaching assistant roles and participation in the Data Science for All Women Summit.

## Technical Skills

I’m proficient in a range of programming languages and tools including:
- **Languages**: Java, Julia, Python, R
- **Tools/Frameworks**: pandas, numpy, scipy, biopython, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, scikit-bio, AWS, Unix, Linux, Slurm Scheduler


## Interests

Outside of research, I enjoy running, hiking, and zumba. I am passionate about increasing participation and retention in the Environmental Data Science community.
